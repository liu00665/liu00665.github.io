        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p><strong>Welcome to my page!</strong><br>My name is <em>Kexin Liu</em>.I am a <em>girl</em> come from <abbr title="southern city of China">Hangzhou</abbr>,China,Hangzhou is a beautiful tourism city.I've lived there for 30 years,and I just had my 30<sup>th</sup> birthday before coming to Canada.I am an animal person I have two cats called <q>Wanwan</q> and <q>thirdteen</q>,and a dog called <q>Diudiu</q>.and I love <em>gaming</em> and <em>watching animes and movies</em> in my free time.
        </p>
       
        <p>Now I am currently studying <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program in Algonquin College.The reason why I chose this program is because I was major in <abbr title="The art and process of creating patterns, textures, and structures for woven, knitted, or printed fabrics and materials.">Textile Design</abbr> when I was in China,and that's kind of related to Interactive Media Design.Also I would like to improve my design skills and learn to be more creative and learn some new things like web development and photography.<br><b>I hope that I can fit in and have a new life here!and I believe that I can do it!</b>
